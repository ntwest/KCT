Kerbal Construction Time is a plugin which, at its core, is designed to make vessels take time to build rather than being able to constantly launch new vessels one after another. 

This core feature is expanded upon to create a larger system for managing your space center. 
	- Build your vessels
	- Upgrade your facilities
	- Research new technologies
	- Make decisions where you never had to before!
	
Do I upgrade the VAB further or start upgrading the SPH? Do I want to build single vessels quickly, or multiple vessels at once? Is getting new tech faster worth building ships slower? Do I use these old parts to be ready for the transfer window, or do I use new parts with better stats?

When combined with other realism based addons, especially life support addons, the experience is even better. No longer can you send out a rescue mission without consequence, making planning that much more important.

KCT has even more features than what is mentioned here. Check out the forum page for a (mostly) full list, or the Getting Started Guide for a detailed explanation of all of the features.

Source code: https://github.com/magico13/KCT
Issue Tracker: https://github.com/magico13/KCT/issues

Installation instructions:
Merge the GameData folder with the GameData folder in your KSP install. For Steam users, this is generally C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program.
When updating from an older version, generally only the KerbalConstructionTime.dll needs to be replaced, though to be safe you should delete the entire KerbalConstructionTime folder.

Submitting bug reports:
Submit bug reports to the github issue tracker or the forum page listed above. Please include the output_log.txt file from the KSP_Data folder (or KSP_x64_Data if using 64 bit) from a play-session where the bug occured with your bug report or else I probably can't help you. Please try to make sure that KCT is actually causing the issue by removing all other mods and testing, then by using all other mods except KCT. If the problem occurs without KCT, it's probably not KCT. If the problem occurs with JUST KCT, then it is very likely a KCT problem.
If at all possible, please include directions about how to replicate the issue and screenshots or video as appropriate!
